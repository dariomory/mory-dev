As the project lead for the SDG Invoervoorziening, I guided our team through the development of a robust CMS and API, focused on optimizing product management for Dutch government entities. Our work not only enhanced the uniformity and accessibility of this data but also established a framework for their efficient update and reuse. This project stands as a testament to our commitment to improving public sector information dissemination and collaboration.
