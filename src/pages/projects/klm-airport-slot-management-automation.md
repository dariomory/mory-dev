As a Software Engineer Level 4 (senior/lead) at KLM, I designed and architected a comprehensive cloud migration strategy for KLM's airport slot management system. Part of the project involved replacing legacy scheduling infrastructure with a modern, microservices-based platform built on Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. I designed a scalable microservices architecture using Python (FastAPI) and C++ for high-performance scheduling logic, architected Kubernetes-based container orchestration for reliable and scalable deployments, and led API design and development for real-time data integration with legacy systems. I used Enterprise Architect software to model and design the system architecture, ensuring alignment with enterprise standards and best practices. I established CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code practices, and integrated. Throughout the project, I participated in regular meetings with Product Owners and stakeholders to align technical solutions with business requirements and ensure successful delivery.
