As a Senior Software Engineer at Bettyblocks, I contributed to the development of the low-code / no-code application platform that enables both professional and citizen developers to rapidly build complex web applications. The project involved building a scalable platform architecture using Elixir for the backend services, providing robust concurrency and fault-tolerance capabilities essential for enterprise applications. I maintained and enhanced React-based front-end components built with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and code quality across the codebase, and maintained GraphQL APIs to enable flexible and efficient data fetching between the front-end and backend services. I collaborated with the platform team to integrate WebAssembly (WASM) compatible extensions, balancing visual development capabilities with extensibility through custom code. I collaborated closely with product, design, and platform teams to support rapid prototyping, workflow automation, and enterprise integrations, improving development speed and strengthening alignment between business requirements and technical execution. The project followed agile methodologies and Scrum framework, with regular sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives to ensure iterative delivery and continuous improvement.
